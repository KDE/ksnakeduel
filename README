Hello!

KTron is a simple tron-clone for the K Desktop Environment.
I think it's just nothing to say about the game:
avoid running into walls, your own tail, and that of your opponent.

Read the Online-Documentation for more details.


Notice:
Parts of the code, especially parts of the algorithm for the computerplayer
are from xtron-1.1 by Rhett D. Jacobs <rhett@hotel.canberra.edu.au>
